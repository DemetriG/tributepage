            <ul>
                <li><strong>1986: Birth of a Square Sponge</strong> - On a sunny day in Bikini Bottom, the cheerful square sponge, SpongeBob
                    SquarePants, was born. Instead of crying like regular babies, he giggled
                    with bubbles.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1992: Graduation from Mrs. Puff's Boating School</strong> - At the
                    tender age of six, SpongeBob graduated from boating school and
                    received his "Pretend License," complete with crayon drawings and glitter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1999: Jellyfishing Expedition</strong> - SpongeBob embarked on his
                    first epic jellyfishing expedition with Patrick and Squidward. They
                    accidentally discovered the "Jellysplosion," a rare phenomenon where
                    jellyfish dance in harmony, creating a brilliant light show.
